We can see that both the values for CO2 and CH4 rise at an extraordinary rate compared to the previous years.

The gradual decrease in CO2 after an emmision can take thousands of years to return back to normal levels accoring to Archer et al. (2009)$^{10}$ which may explain why our graph shows the seemingly very slow decrease as CO2 readings return back to normal levels after each peak.\n",

Zickfield and Harrington (2015)$^9$ suggest that temperature increases associated with CO2 emmisions take longer because the oceans initially take the majority of the heat but over time that slows and the atmosphere then starts to warm which potentially explains the small time lag. Research by Ricke and Caldeira (2014)$^{11}$ suggests that the impact on temperature after a CO2 emmission can last for centuries although the maximum warming is felt within a decade.\n",

    "The graph shows that if the current rate of increase in CO2 levels continues at the same rate then we could expect to see CO2 levels reach over 480 ppm by the year 2050 compared to the 420 ppm level of today. Published models suggest that CO2 levels could range as high as 600 by the year 2050 if current rates of increases continue. However the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) have predicted a level of between 450 and 580 with the average coming in at just under 500 ppm depending on socioeconomic pathways $^{12}$ as shown below.\n",

    "Replotting our Temperature Anomoly graph for the last 170 years we see a steady value up until 1974. Then the value starts to drift above zero indicating that the temperature is getting higher than the average for the last 1000 years. Mooney and Osaka(2023)$^{13}$ writing in The Washington Post report that from 1880 to 1969 there was a relatively small (0.04 degrees celcius) increase per decade in global temperature but that since the early 1970s the planet has seen accelerated warming of almost 0.2 degress celcius each decade. This temperature rise is directly attributed to CO2 levels increasing says Milman (2023)$^{14}$ but questions whether the rate of global heating is accelerating.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A report by the WWF $^{15}$ also suggests that rises in levels of CO2 are directly impacting temperature levels which in turn are causing more sea ice and glaciers to melt. Ice effectively acts like a barrier to the earth's surface and reflects back sunlight to help keep the planet cooler. As the amount of ice decreases, less light is reflected back resulting in an increase in temperature. Combined with the already seen increase in temperature due to CO2 and other greenhouse gases, this addition of a loss of protection from sunligth can have an accelerating effect on temperature.\n",

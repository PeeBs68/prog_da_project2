### Introduction
The purpose of this notebook is to perform and analysis of paleo to present climate data focusing on areas such as CO2 levels, temperature anomolies and methane levesls. It will also present an analysis of Irish Rainfall and Temperature.


### CO2 vs Temperature Anomoly
In this section we look at the relationship netween CO2 levels and Temperature Anomolies for a date range between 800000 BC and present (2023).

### Global CH4 (Methane) Levels Analysis
Next we will look at CH4 levels globally and investigate it's relationship with CO2 and Temperature Anomolies.

### Irish Rainfall and Temperature Analysis
In this section we perform an analysis of Irish Data, in particular Rainfall levles and Temperature.

### Data Export
We firstly fuse the data from multiple data sources to a single dataframe and then export it to JSON and CSV file formats.

### Future Predictions
This section is to show how the future looks in terms of Temperature Anomoly based on current trends in CO2 levels.
